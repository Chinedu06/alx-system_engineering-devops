# SSH Connection Script

This project contains a Bash script for connecting to a server using SSH with a specified private key.

## Task 0: Use a Private Key

The `0-use_a_private_key` script connects to a server using SSH with the private key located at `~/.ssh/school` and the user `ubuntu`.

### Usage

1. Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x 0-use_a_private_key
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    ./0-use_a_private_key
    ```

    Replace `<server_ip>` in the script with the actual IP address or hostname of your server.
